In August 2022, we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61230287) how the share of homegrown doctors and nurses joining England's NHS had reached its lowest point in seven years.

Some 58% of doctors joining the health service in 2021 came from the UK, with health bosses increasingly turning to international recruitment.
The British Medical Association said the NHS faced a "workforce crisis". 

The government, however, insisted there were record numbers of doctors, a rise of 34% since 2010.

While overall numbers had been increasing, critics said declining domestic recruitment was unsustainable to keep pace with demand.

# Methodology

We analysed workforce data provided by NHS Digital showing the nationalities of joiners, leavers and staff in post in England’s NHS from 2015 to 2021, to investigate if [trends we reported following the Brexit referendum in June 2016 continued](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41556997).

We also submitted 27 FOI requests to every health board in Scotland and Wales and every health and social care trust in Northern Ireland for similar data and manually inputted those data into a mastersheet. These data cover the period 2015-2020.

# What we found 

- We found the share of UK doctors joining the health service had fallen from 69% in 2015 to 58% last year.  Over the same period, the share of new UK nurses fell from 74% to 61%.

- Recruitment of doctors from the Rest of the World rose from 18% to 34% over the same period, and that share of international nurses rose from 7% to 34%.
